# 100 Days of Javascript

Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's [180 websites in 180 days](http://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html) and Elle Luna's [100 day project](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days).

## The Rules

1. I will do 100 small Javascript projects.
2. I will not beat myself up if I miss a day or if projects are not done on consecutive days.
3. I will not get distracted by trying to visually design my projects. The goal is to learn Javascript.
4. I will ask for help when I need it.
5. I will not feel bad for using jQuery, CoffeeScript, or any other JS-related language/framework that is not "vanilla Javascript."
